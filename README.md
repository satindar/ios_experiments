Trying out new things using Swift and Xcode6

Quite a few new things to learn and many videos to watch from WWDC 14. Plus with Playgrounds it's easy to try just one thing and keep a reference for future development. 

I'll keep a list of ideas here (ideas from videos, blogs, tutorials , or my own) and add code when I finally try them out (if I try them out!).
